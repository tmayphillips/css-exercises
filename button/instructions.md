# :Pseudo-classes

In this activity you'll use pseudo-classes to style elements based on their state.

## Instructions

- Create a series of links and modify the pseudo-classes associated with their Default, Active, Hover, and Focus States.

## Bonus

- Incorporate a pseudo-class we haven’t covered in your page. Then read about “pseudo-elements” and try to incorporate one as well.
